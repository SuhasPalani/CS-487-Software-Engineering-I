American Airlines Flight 965, a Boeing 757-200, crashed into a mountain near Buga, Colombia, on December 20, 1995, resulting in 159 fatalities out of 163 people on board[1]. This tragic accident offers several key insights:

## Navigation and Human Error

The crash was primarily caused by navigational errors made by the flight crew. Despite being experienced pilots, they made critical mistakes:

1. Clearing programmed approach waypoints from the flight management system (FMS)
2. Misidentifying navigation beacons due to naming convention differences
3. Failing to disengage speed brakes during the final attempt to avoid collision

These errors highlight the importance of maintaining situational awareness and proper use of automation systems, especially in challenging terrain.

## Communication Challenges

The air traffic controller noticed inconsistencies in the pilots' requests but couldn't effectively communicate his concerns due to limited English proficiency. This underscores the critical need for clear communication protocols and language proficiency in international aviation.

## Technology Limitations

1. The lack of functional radar at Cali's airport, destroyed by a terror group, hindered air traffic control's ability to monitor the flight.
2. The flight management system's logic, which dropped intermediate fixes from displays when direct routing was executed, contributed to the navigational confusion.

These factors emphasize the importance of robust and redundant navigation systems.

## Safety Improvements

The accident led to significant safety enhancements in the aviation industry:

1. Introduction of Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems (EGPWS) in 1996
2. Mandatory advanced terrain awareness warning systems for certain aircraft categories since 2002

## Legal and Ethical Implications

The aftermath of the crash revealed complex legal issues:

1. Initial ruling of "willful misconduct" by pilots, later reversed on appeal
2. Lawsuits and settlements involving American Airlines, Jeppesen, and Honeywell
3. Problems with post-crash scavenging of aircraft parts, highlighting the need for secure crash sites

These insights demonstrate how a combination of human factors, technological limitations, and systemic issues can lead to catastrophic outcomes in aviation, while also showing how such tragedies can drive important safety improvements in the industry.
