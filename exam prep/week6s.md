##### **Reliability and System Dependency:**

In both text files, the lecturer discusses **reliability** and the challenges of ensuring system reliability, particularly when systems depend on external partners. Some key points include:

1. **Concept of Reliability**:

   - A reliable system produces the correct output and facilitates correct behavior on a consistent basis.
   - The lecturer emphasizes that perfect reliability is difficult to achieve. This is mainly due to **complex environments**, where multiple unknowns may impact the system, making it hard to ensure flawless operation 100% of the time.
   - **System reliability** is tied to how the system supports its partners (other systems or users) and its consistent behavior under all conditions【8†source】【9†source】.

2. **Partner Dependencies**:

   - The lecturer provides real-world examples like **Microsoft's dependency on CrowdStrike**, where system reliability is impacted by external partners. If CrowdStrike makes an error, it can cause Microsoft systems to fail, leading to large-scale failures for users such as **Delta Airlines**【9†source】.
   - This example illustrates how **partner dependencies** affect system reliability and how failures propagate from one partner to another, ultimately impacting end-users【8†source】【9†source】.

3. **Testing and Assessing Reliability**:
   - The lecturer talks about **testing strategies** for systems, emphasizing the importance of identifying potential boundary conditions, vulnerabilities, and ambiguous requirements in partner systems. High-level testing is often necessary when requirements are ambiguous or incomplete.
   - It's suggested that **user feedback** plays a key role in assessing a system's reliability. Peer reviews (as used in team projects) also help identify gaps in system design and requirements【9†source】.

##### **Real-Time Examples and Application Scenarios**:

1. **Example 1: Microsoft and CrowdStrike**:

   - **Scenario**: Microsoft relies on CrowdStrike for security updates, and when CrowdStrike releases an update with a flaw, it causes a global outage of Microsoft systems. This affected not only Microsoft but also companies like Delta Airlines, which relies on Microsoft.
   - **Application**: This demonstrates how a **single point of failure** in a partner system can lead to cascading effects across multiple businesses. A real-world takeaway is that companies need to either diversify their partners or have contingency plans in place【9†source】.

2. **Example 2: Self-Driving Cars**:
   - **Scenario**: A self-driving car depends on various sensors and software systems to function reliably. If one of these systems fails (e.g., a sensor malfunction), the car could drive unsafely or make incorrect decisions, leading to accidents.
   - **Application**: This emphasizes the need for redundancy in mission-critical systems like self-driving cars. A real-world takeaway is to implement multiple layers of safety checks and backups for vital systems【8†source】【9†source】.

1. **Dependability and Reliability**:

   - Dependability involves **repairability**, **maintainability**, **survivability**, and **error tolerance**【7†source】.
   - Reliability is often quantified by **measurable performance standards** and the ability to avoid failure. Systems that can survive attacks or recover from failures are considered dependable【7†source】.

2. **Risk Management**:

   - Risk is calculated by **likelihood times impact**. This formula helps in determining the risk exposure of a system, whether it's hardware, software, or operational failure【7†source】.
   - Systems should be designed to mitigate risks during their entire life cycle. After the architecture decisions are made, continuous risk assessment is essential【7†source】.

3. **Failure Categories**:

   - **Hardware failure** can stem from design errors or component failure.
   - **Software failure** often arises from requirement issues or coding defects.
   - **Operational failure** happens due to user misuse or unforeseen operational challenges【7†source】.

4. **Safety-Critical Systems**:

   - These include **embedded system controllers** that, if they fail, could lead to the failure of the system they control. An example is the flight control system in airplanes【7†source】.

5. **Security and Vulnerabilities**:
   - The increasing openness of systems, due to data sharing and remote access, introduces vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access and data breaches【7†source】.
   - **Security management** requires controlling user access and deploying systems in a secure manner, especially through regular patching and monitoring【7†source】.

##### **Real-Time Examples and Application Scenarios**:

1. **Example 1: Embedded Safety-Critical Systems in Aircraft**:

   - **Scenario**: An aircraft's embedded flight control system fails, causing the entire plane to malfunction. This type of failure could result in catastrophic consequences.
   - **Application**: This highlights the importance of redundancy in safety-critical systems like aircraft. Engineers must design these systems with backup controls to ensure they can recover from failures【7†source】.

2. **Example 2: Cybersecurity in Cloud Systems**:
   - **Scenario**: A company’s cloud system is vulnerable to unauthorized access because of improper security configurations, leading to a data breach.
   - **Application**: This shows the need for robust **security engineering** practices, such as restricting user access and frequently updating security protocols【7†source】.

### Conclusion:

The text files emphasize the challenges in **maintaining system reliability** and the importance of **testing, feedback, and dependency management**, using real-world examples like the Microsoft-CrowdStrike incident. The PDF extends this by exploring **dependability** in a broader context, covering **failure categories, risk management**, and **security**, with practical applications in safety-critical systems like aircraft and cloud security systems.

To provide a more exam-focused and in-depth explanation of the concepts, let's break down the key topics and explore them in detail, focusing on potential exam questions and critical understanding.
