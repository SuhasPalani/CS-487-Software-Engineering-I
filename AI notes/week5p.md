## Introduction and Context

The lecture is part of CS 487 Software Engineering course at Illinois Institute of Technology, taught by Dennis Hood. Week 5 focuses on design, modeling, and architecture, bridging the gap between analysis and implementation phases[1].

**Purpose of Design:**
- Clarifies requirements by breaking them down into manageable components
- Provides a blueprint for developers during implementation
- Helps identify potential risks early in the system development process[1]

## Importance of Visual Representation

Visual representations are crucial in software engineering as they effectively communicate complex ideas. The concept "A Picture is Worth 1000 Words" applies here[1].

**Role in Software Engineering:**
- Translates requirements into design specifications
- Represents business processes
- Reduces ambiguity and improves understanding among team members[1]

## Types of Models

### Context Models
Define system boundaries and interactions with external entities. Example: A context diagram for an online library management system[1].

### Interaction Models
- **Use Case Diagrams:** Show system functionalities and actors. Example: Banking system use cases like "Withdraw Money," "Check Balance"[1].
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Represent interactions between objects over time. Example: Login process sequence[1].

### Structural Models
- **Class Diagrams:** Depict static structure of a system, showing classes, attributes, methods, and relationships[1].

**Key Concepts:**
- Classes and Objects
- Relationships: Inheritance, Aggregation, Composition[1]

### Behavioral Models
- **Data-flow Models:** Show data movement through the system. Example: Data flow diagram for university admission system[1].
- **Event-driven Models:** Depict system behavior through states and transitions. Example: Vending machine state diagram[1].

### Data Models
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams:** Show data entities, attributes, and relationships[1].
- **Data Dictionary:** Provides details about data elements[1].

## Design Patterns

Reusable solutions to common software design problems[1].

**Categories:**
- Creational Patterns: Object creation mechanisms
- Structural Patterns: Object composition
- Behavioral Patterns: Communication between objects[1]

**Example - Observer Pattern:**
- Problem: Notifying multiple objects of state changes
- Solution: One-to-many dependency between objects for automatic updates[1]

## From Design to Implementation

- **Reuse:** Encourages use of design patterns and object-oriented design[1].
- **Configuration Management:** Includes version control, build management, and issue tracking[1].
- **Host-Target Development:** Development environment should mimic target environment[1].

## Architecture

**Architecture Levels:**
- Program-Level: Focuses on individual modules
- System/Enterprise-Level: Deals with large-scale integration[1]

**Benefits:**
- Facilitates communication among stakeholders
- Ensures comprehensive analysis
- Promotes reuse of architectural patterns[1]

**Non-functional Requirements:**
- Performance, Security, Scalability[1]

## Architectural Views

- Logical View: Describes system functionality
- Process View: Focuses on dynamic aspects and communication
- Development View: Depicts static organization in development environment
- Physical View: Shows mapping of software onto hardware
- Conceptual View: High-level representation of system architecture[1]

## Architectural Patterns

- **Layered Architecture:** System divided into layers with specific responsibilities[1].
- **Repository Architecture:** Central repository accessed by all components[1].
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Clients request services from a central server[1].
- **Pipe-and-Filter Architecture:** Data passes through series of processing elements[1].

## Distributed Systems

**Types:**
- Multiprocessor Architectures
- Client-Server Architectures
- Distributed Object Architectures[1]

**Patterns:**
- Master-Slave Architecture
- 2-tier and Multi-tier Architectures
- Peer-to-peer Architecture[1]

## Practical Application: Entertainment System Design

- **System Requirements:** In-vehicle entertainment system specifications[1].
- **HCI and CCI:** Human-Computer Interaction and Computer-Computer Interaction considerations[1].
- **Protocol Design:** Rules for communication between system components[1].
- **Handling Failures:** Automated detection and simplification strategies[1].
- **Learning and Adaptation:** System adapts to user preferences[1]

## Conclusion

The design phase is crucial for translating requirements into implementable solutions. It requires balancing detail with flexibility and adopting an iterative approach based on user feedback and technical constraints[1].
